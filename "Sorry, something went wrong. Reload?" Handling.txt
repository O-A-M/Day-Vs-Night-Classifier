"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" Handling:
------------------------------------------------
Sol1:
Try to reload the github page several times till opening.

Sol2:
1. "Download ZIP" the code through the "Code" green button appears on the top right.
2. Extract the zipped code file.
3. Assuming that Anaconda3 is already installed, open up the terminal and change the directory (cd) to the code file location
i.e. username:~/Downloads/Day-Vs-Night-Classifier$
4. Type "jupyter notebook" and then click the Enter key  
i.e. username:~/Downloads/Day-Vs-Night-Classifier$ jupyter notebook
5. Open up "Day Vs Night Classifier.ipynb" notebook.
6. Congrats, you can now test the code.
